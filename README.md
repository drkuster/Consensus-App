The Consensus App is an extension of Twitter. A user can log in with their Twitter account and view a list of trending topics and hashtags. When a topic or hashtag is tapped, my app pulls a mix of 25 recent and popular tweets relating to the topic, perform a sentiment analysis on each tweet, thus determining how people feel about that topic.
